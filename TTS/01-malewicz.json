        "Sometimes when looking at a work of art we wonder what the author wanted to convey to us, but it is impossible to know without being the author. Looking at some paintings, one would like to become a part of it in order to understand it better.",
        "I want to show you something. Come closer. Let yourself be absorbed.",
        "You're probably looking at me now thinking I have nothing inside. Have you given me value because some man in authority told you it was the right thing to do? I invite you to. Look more closely. Some paintings we don't understand despite looking at them for hours. Indeed, sometimes if you don't become part of the work, you won't be able to understand it.",
        "Who are you? Do you know the answer? Do you know who you are for yourself? And do you know who you are for the other person? For each person you will be a little different. Chaos in order. Order in chaos. There is a certain space for those contradictions that are not actually contradictions. Welcome to the world of mathematical ideas, where everyone finds their spaces, depending on what they are looking for. Here there is orderly chaos.",
        "Endless darkness. Silence. Flashes of shapes, fractals, objects. Order. Two colours. Absence of stimuli. Harmony. The ideal World of Ideas."
